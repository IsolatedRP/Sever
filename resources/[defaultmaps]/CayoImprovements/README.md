Designed for RP and exploration in mind, CayoImprovements enhances the island by removing obstructing collisions, adds more vegetation, street lights, heist props and socializing opportunities.

**This resource is for FiveM usage with the understanding that you will not modify, sell or reupload elsewhere without my permission.**

It is to work alongside [[pmms](https://github.com/kibook/pmms)] for playing content on the TV screens, as well as [[fivem-scenarios](https://github.com/kibook/fivem-scenarios)] for interacting with scenarios around the world, including Cayo Perico.

This is a passion project of mine that began in December of 2020 to self teach myself Codewalker and has been constantly updated and developed since.

Screenshots are provided in their respective folder.


I hope you enjoy üòä

# Configuring PMMS ‚öôÔ∏è

# Static Emitters üé∂

I have disabled the static emitters at the Arena Wars location, however if you are using PMMS alongside my Cayo Perico resource, PMMS disables static emitters when media is being rendered, and reenables them when the media has stopped playing, therefore, it counteracts with this resource. 

To 'fix' this, open the `staticEmitters.lua` file inside the PMMS resource, and set the following to false like so;

```
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_Arena_Crowd_Background_Main", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_arena_VIP_Radio", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_x18_int_mod_garage_radio", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_x18_int_mod2_garage_radio", enabled = false},
```

# BUGS üêõ

Due to the hangar being **modified** and additional props placed inside, having both islands active *(via removing the native)*, causes an issue with the hangar appearing.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TELEPORTING TO AND FROM THE ISLAND **MAY** CAUSE ISSUES. USE A BRIDGE, PLANE, HELICOPTER OR BOAT** ‚ö†Ô∏è

some IPL Loader scripts have the following code:

```
LoadMpDlcMaps()
EnableMpDlcMaps(true)
```

This conflicts with Cayo Perico, as my resources are already requesting the required IPLs, maps, and entitysets. 

Set it to false and request your IPLs the correct way.
---------------------------------------

# **HANGAR COLLISIONS üõ©Ô∏è:**

The hangar collision file is also in the `OPTIONAL` folder.

If you happen to have the '"[Cayo Perico Shops MLO](https://forum.cfx.re/t/mlo-cayo-perico-shops/1994908)' resource, as well as mine, the server refuses to read the collision file for shops, but instead, read mine, making the shop collisions not work. 

Just copy and paste mine, or the Cayo Perico Shops collision file **(h4_islandairstrip_12)** into the ybn folder. 

---------------------------------------

# Frameworks & Other Cayo Perico Resources / Scripts Support:

I don't use any fancy frameworks or any other Cayo Perico related resources, so you'll have to troubleshoot it on your **own.**

---------------------------------------


# Installation üíæ: 

* Download repository and put the `CayoImprovements` folder in your server files

* Add `h4_islandairstrip_12` from the `Original Hangar Collison` folder, and insert it into `CayoImprovements` > `stream` > `ybn` folder. If you are using the Cayo Perico Shops resource, ignore this step


* Choose between `No Flight Or Water Vehicles` or `No Vehicles`, and insert the files into the `CayoImprovements` > `stream` > `ymap` folder, replacing the existing files. If you enjoy the vehicles spawning on the island, ignore this step. If at any time you need the vehicles back, grab the files from `Vehicles BACKUP` and place them into the `CayoImprovements` > `stream` > `ymap` folder.

* add `start CayoImprovements` to your server.cfg

* Restart server or type `/start CayoImprovements` into the chat window

# FAQ üí¨

**Q: How can I change what's inside the cabinet in the basement?**

**A:** These are called entitysets and can be changed in the cayo_perico_entitysets.lua file.

------------

**Q: Can I delete, change or turn off the invincible NPC peds on the island?**

**A:** Yes, open peds_config.lua and everything has been configured there. You can add / remove entries, or comment it out from the fxmanifest to completely disable them.

You will also need to comment out main_peds.lua if you want to disable them completely.

------------

**Q: How come I can't see Cayo Perico unless I get close to the Aircraft Carrier or near where the island is, and the minimap doesn't appear??**

**A:** It's concealed the way Rockstar Games created it, and it had to be done this way to make the modified hangar work.

------------

**Q: When I use this resource, I can't use Rockstar Editor. Why?**

**A:** This should be fixed, as the Cfx.re team have pushed an update on February 8th 2022 which implemented some CPacketIPL changes for the replay editor. This should fix replay editor issues on build 2189 and above with common IPL loading resources.

Read about it [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/cfx-re-client-update-fivem-redm-for-february-8th-2022/4813410)

------------

**Q: I bought something from someone that looked similar to this?**

**A:** Yikes. My resources are always free and some people pry on free resources to sell them off as their own, usually on some shady website or their discord servers. 

Unfortunately you've been scammed and I cannot help you get a refund or anything of that manner.

------------

**Q: Can you move the island to...**

**A: NO**

------------

**Q: I added a bridge but there's trees. Can you remove them for me?

**A: NO**

------------------

**Q: Can I DM you / can you help me personally one on one?**

**A:** No. Don't DM me on the FiveM forums and don't try to add me on Discord.
